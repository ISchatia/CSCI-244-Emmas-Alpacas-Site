    "Title": "Basic Facts",
    "Info": "Alpacas are members of the South American Camelid Family. This includes camels, llamas, alpacas, vicunas, and guancos. Unlike llamas, which were primarily used as pack-animals, alpacas were raised for their cashmere-like fiber. They have been domesticated for over 5,000 years. Alpacas are native to the Andean Mountain Range of South America and are primarily found in Bolivia, Chile and Peru. Alpacas are often raised as an alternative to sheep farming. The importation of alpacas was stopped in 1998. The alpacas that are here are the only breeding stock to improve bloodlines. This makes breeding them a good investment opportunity."

    "Title": "Alpaca Types",
    "Info": "There are two types of alpacas, the suri(su-ree) and the huacaya(wah-kai-yuh). The suri accounts for only 5% of alpacas in the US. It has fiber that grows quite long and forms what look like dreadlocks. The huacaya has shorter and more dense fleece, it looks similar to sheep's wool but there is no lanolin or greasiness as found in sheep's wool."
